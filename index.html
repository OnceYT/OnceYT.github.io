    <u><h1 align = "center">Management By Objectives - A Brief</h1></u>
    <p align = "center">Management by objectives (MBO) is a strategic management model that aims to improve the performance of an organization by clearly defining objectives that are agreed to by both management and employees. This also involves devising an <u>Action Plan</u> and regular monitoring of the same.</p>
    <br>
    <u><h1 align = "center">Steps Involved in MBO</h1></u>
    <p>Management by objectives is in effect a joint process of objectives setting and a joint appraisal or review of achievement or non-achievement by an executive or manager and his subordinate.</p>
    <h3>1. Defining Organisational Goals.</h3>The management should first clearly identify and define their organisational goals which, the organisation will follow during this particular financial period.
    <h3>2. Defining Employer Objectives.</h3>The management should now communicate their objectives with the Employees and Workers, clarify the functioning and make changes if necessary based on the feedback they recieve from the staff.
    <h3>3. Monitoring of Employee Performance and Progress.</h3>Employee performance should be regularly monitored if they are working on the level they are expected to work. The management should also solve and mitigate discrepancies if any might arise amongst the employees to ensure a hassle free work environment.
    <h3>4. Performance Evaluation / Review.</h3>Employees should be evaluated if they are coming up to the expectations of the organisation. They should further be given feedback as in which key-areas they should try to improve!
    <h3>5. Providing Feedback / Appraisal.</h3>If the employee is coming up to the expectations of the organisation and if they are working very effeciently, they should be provided appraisals such as bonuses, promotions or even holidays.
    <h3>6. Performance Appraisal.</h3>Performance appraisals will in return boost the morale of the employees and workers motivating them to work harder and give in their best, in return.
